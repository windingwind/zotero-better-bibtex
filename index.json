If you want to get the stock zotero keys, set the pattern in the preferences to [zotero]. I very much recommend not choosing [zotero] as your pattern unless you have existing articles that use keys generated by previous Zotero-native BibTeX export.\nNote: BBT needs to be installed in Zotero, not Firefox. There used to be two versions of Zotero, one standalone, and one that was installed in Firefox. BBT is a Zotero extension and lives where Zotero lives; Zotero is no longer available as a Firefox plugin, only as standalone.\nOn first install you will be asked a few questions. Please read these instead of just clicking through.\n"

	"content": "Better BibTex adds a couple of export formats to Zotero\u0026rsquo;s export dialog and several ways to improve export for plaintext-based authoring. The Better BibTeX configuration pane can be found under the regular Zotero preferences pane, tab \u0026lsquo;Better BibTeX\u0026rsquo; where you can tweak the exports, such as\n Omitting fields from exports to slim down your bib files. Configuring how citation keys are generated. And really a ton more.  Additionally you can automate exporting (parts of) your library either using auto-export or pull export.\nPinning (fixing) the citation key By default, BBT will generate citation keys from your items using the formatting pattern you specified. If you want the key to be stable even when you change the item, you can fix its citation key to a value of your choosing by adding the text Citation Key: [your citekey] on a line of its own in the extra field of the item.\nAdd your own BibLaTeX fields LaTeX fields You can add your own fields to the export which are not derived from regular Zotero item fields by adding them in the extra field:\neither by using lines such as\ntex.origdate= 1856 tex.origtitle= All This \u0026amp; More or\ntex.origdate: 1856 tex.origtitle: All This \u0026amp; More The difference between lines with an = or an : is that the fields marked with = are considered to be valid (\u0026ldquo;raw\u0026rdquo;) latex and will be passed on into the generated files as-is. The lines marked with : are assumed to be plain-text and LaTeX special characters (such as the \u0026amp; above) will be escaped.\nCSL fields The final way to add fields is by using CSL fields in the format {:original-date: 1856} or Original Date: 1856 on a line of its own. These fields will not only be exported to Bib(La)TeX, but will also be picked up by the Zotero Bibliography manager, even though not all Zotero styles yet support this.\nNote that the default biblatex styles do not seem to support origdate; you can find possible solutions for this at Stack Exchange here and here.\nChanging the exported entry type If you add a field called tex.entrytype, the value of that field value will be used as the entry type instead of the one usually inferred from the Zotero item type. You can use this to create, for example, @customa{citekeyhere, ....} type entries.\nBackground exports To help out with larger libraries, BBT will export using an isolated thread (\u0026ldquo;worker thread\u0026rdquo;), which will prevent Zotero from locking up during exports. This was introduced in 5.2.0; at time of writing it passes all tests, and feedback so far has been positive, but it\u0026rsquo;s a wild departure from how Zotero exports work, so I consider it experimental at this stage. If you are experiencing errors,\n please do report them, and you can (temporarily I hope) disable by going into the BBT advanced preferences and drag the parallel exports slider to 0.  If BBT detects an error during background exports, it will disabled them, so that subsequent exports will be foreground exports. You can re-enable them using the same slider by dragging it back to the default 1.\n"

	"content": "Generating citekeys for your items The BibTeX citations keys generated by the standard Zotero exporters are always generated at time of export, using an algorithm that usually generates unique keys. For serious LaTeX users, \u0026ldquo;usually\u0026rdquo; presents the following problems:\n If a non-unique key is generated, which one gets postfixed with a distinguishing character is essentially non-deterministic. The keys are always auto-generated, so if you correct a typo in the author name or title, the key will change You can\u0026rsquo;t see the citation keys until you export them  For a LaTeX author, the citation keys have their own meaning, fully separate from the other entry data, even if people usually pick a naming scheme related to them. As the citation key is the piece of data that connects your bibliography, this is a piece of data you want to have control over. BBT offers you this control:\n Stable citation keys, without key clashes. BBT generates citation keys that take into account other existing keys in your library in a deterministic way, regardless of what part of your library you export, or the order in which you do it. BBT is conservative about citation key changes, and allows you to fix keys to any value of your choosing. Generate citation keys from JabRef(-ish) patterns.  You can also\n Drag and drop LaTeX citations using these keys to your favorite LaTeX editor Show your citation keys in the item list view.  Set your own, fixed citation keys By default, BBT generates the citation key from the item information, and this key may change when you edit the item. Such keys are called dynamic keys, which are marked with a pushpin the item list view and in the item details to distinguish them from dynamic keys.\nYou can fix the citation key (called pinning in BBT) for an item by adding the text Citation Key: \u0026lt;your citekey\u0026gt; anywhere in the extra field of the item on a line of its own. You can generate a pinned citation key by selecting one or more items, right-clicking, and selecting Generate BibTeX key, which will add the current citation key to the extra field, thereby pinning it.\nDrag and drop/hotkey citations You can drag and drop citations into your LaTeX/Markdown/Orgmode editor, and it will add a proper \\cite{citekey}/[@citekey]/[[zotero://select...][@citekey]. The cite command is configurable for LaTeX by setting the config option in the preferences. Do not include the leading backslash.\nThis feature requires a one-time setup: choose the Quick Copy format under the Citation keys preferences for BBT, and go to Zotero preferences, tab Export, under Default Output Format, select \u0026ldquo;Better BibTeX Quick Copy: [format you just selected]\u0026rdquo;.\nFind duplicate keys through integration with Report Customizer The plugin will generate BibTeX comments to show whether a key conflicts and with which entry. BBT integrates with Zotero: Report Customizer to display the BibTeX key plus any conflicts between them in the zotero report.\nConfigurable citekey generator BBT also implements a citekey generator for those entries that don\u0026rsquo;t have a citekey set explicitly; the formatter pattern language used to follow the JabRef key formatting syntax, but now uses a javascript-ish format. You can set your generator pattern in the Better BibTeX preferences (you can get there via the Zotero preferences, or by clicking the Better BibTeX \u0026ldquo;Preferences\u0026rdquo; button in the addons pane.\nThe default key pattern is auth.lower + shorttitle(3,3) + year; if you have papers that use keys which were generated by the key generator of the standard Bib(La)TeX exporters of Zotero you may want to use zotero.clean instead in order to ease migration from existing exports for people who previously used the standard Zotero Bib(La)TeX exports. You will be offered this choice on first run of BBT.\nA common pattern is auth.lower + year, which means\n last name of first author without spaces, in lowercase year of publication if any, a letter postfix (a, b, c, etc) in case of a clash (this part is always added, you can\u0026rsquo;t disable it, although you can change it to Zotero-style numeric)  Changing a pattern will only affect items created/changed after you changed the pattern; existing keys are not automatically regenerated when you change the pattern. If you want your keys to update after a pattern change you will have to select your items, right-click, and select Refresh. This will not affect keys you have pinned.\nIf you want to get fancy, you can set multiple patterns separated by a vertical bar, of which the first will be applied that yields a non-empty string. If all return a empty string, a random key will be generated.\nAn example application for this behavior is to use the tex.shortauthor from the extra field when defined to generate short citation keys for entries with long group author names, but to default to auth.lower otherwise:\nextra(\u0026#39;tex.shortauthor\u0026#39;).transliterate.clean.lower.len + year | auth.lower + year You can add a verbatim text by just including it in single or double quotes:\nextra(\u0026#39;tex.shortauthor\u0026#39;).transliterate.clean.lower.len + year | \u0026#39;default\u0026#39; + auth.lower + year Generating citekeys To generate your citekeys, you use a formula composed of functions and filters. Broadly, functions grab text from your item, and filters transform that text. Note that the formula syntax has changed from a bracketed format to a javascript-ish format. The old syntax was getting harder to maintain and its inflexibility prevented new extensions to the functions being implemented cleanly. The old syntax still works and will be translated to the new format automatically and displayed below the old format if you use it. At some point not too far away, BBT will automatically upgrade old patterns and use those directly. But for now you can choose which format you use.\nBelow you will find a full list of functions and filters you can use, in the new format only, sorry. You can till use these in the old syntax, but they support only positional parameters, where I would recommend generally to use the new syntax with named parameters.\nFunctions  auth parameters:  parametertypedescriptiondefault  nnumberthe number of characters to take from the name, 0 = all\n0  mnumberselect the mth author\n1  creatorauthor / editorselect from authors or only from editors\n'author'  initialsbooleanadd author initials\nfalse  cleanbooleantransliterates the citation key and removes unsafe characters\ntrue     The first n (default: all) characters of the mth (default: first) author's last name.  authAuthEa parameters:  parametertypedefault  creatorauthor / editor'author'  initialsbooleanfalse  sepstring'.'  cleanbooleantrue     The last name of the first two authors, and \".ea\" if there are more than two.  authEtAl parameters:  parametertypedefault  creatorauthor / editor'author'  initialsbooleanfalse  sepstring' '  cleanbooleantrue     The last name of the first author, and the last name of the second author if there are two authors or \"EtAl\" if there are more than two.

You might want to use the abbr filter on this. Abbreviation behavior can be specified as abbrev+auto (the default) which uses the explicit journal abbreviation if present, and tries the automatic abbreviator if not (if auto-abbrev is enabled in the preferences), auto (skip explicit journal abbreviation even if present), abbrev (no auto-abbrev even if it is enabled in the preferences) or off (no abbrevation).  keyword parameters:  parametertypedefault  nnumber    Tag number n  language parameters:  parametertypedescriptiondefault  nameame / american / australian / austrian / bri / british / canadian / chinese / chinese-hans / chinese-hans-hk / chinese-hans-mo / chinese-hans-sg / chinese-hant / chinese-hant-hk / chinese-hant-mo / chinese-simplified / chinese-simplified-hongkongsarchina / chinese-simplified-macausarchina / chinese-simplified-singapore / chinese-traditional / chinese-traditional-hongkongsarchina / chinese-traditional-macausarchina / de / de-1901 / de-at / de-at-1901 / de-ch / de-ch-1901 / de-ch-1996 / de-de / deutsch / en / en-au / en-ca / en-en / en-gb / en-nz / en-us / eng / english / english-au / english-australia / english-ca / english-canada / english-gb / english-newzealand / english-nz / english-unitedkingdom / english-unitedstates / english-us / ger / german / german-at / german-austria / german-ch / german-switzerland / gsw / ja / ja-ja / jap / japanese / new / newzealand / nsw / nswissgerman / schwiizertüütsch / swi / swiss german / swissgerman / ukenglish / usenglish / zh / zh-hans / zh-hans-hk / zh-hans-mo / zh-hans-sg / zh-hant / zh-hant-hk / zh-hant-mo / zh-zh / 中文 / 日本語...one or more language codes\n    Tests whether the item has the given language set, and skips to the next pattern if not  lastpageThe number of the last page of the publication (See the remark on firstpage)  len parameters:  parametertypedefault  relation!= /  /  / = /  / =''  lengthnumber0     If the length of the output does not match the given number, skip to the next pattern.  libraryreturns the name of the shared group library, or nothing if the item is in your personal library  monththe month of the publication  origdatethe original date of the publication  origyearthe original year of the publication  postfix parameters:  parametertypedefault  formatstring'%(a)s'  startnumber0     a pseudo-function that sets the citekey disambiguation postfix using an sprintf-js format spec for when a key is generated that already exists.

For the rest of the disambiguator you can use things like padding and extra text as sprintf-js allows. With +1 the disambiguator is always included, even if there is no need for it when no duplicates exist. The default format is %(a)s.  shorttitle parameters:  parametertypedefault  nnumber3  mnumber0     The first n (default: 3) words of the title, apply capitalization to first m (default: 0) of those  shortyearThe last 2 digits of the publication year  titleCapitalize all the significant words of the title, and concatenate them.

The format is select(start,number) (1-based), so select(1,4) or select(n=4) would select the first four words. If n is not given, all words from start to the end are selected.  skipwordsfilters out common words like 'of', 'the', … the list of words can be seen and changed by going into about:config under the key extensions.zotero.translators.better-bibtex.skipWords as a comma-separated, case-insensitive list of words.\nIf you want to strip words like 'Jr.' from names, you could use something like [Auth:nopunct:skipwords:fold] after adding jr to the skipWords list. Note that this filter is always applied if you use title (which is different from Title) or shorttitle.  splitIdeographsTreat ideaographs as individual words  substring parameters:  parametertypedefault  startnumber1  nnumber    substring(start,n) selects n (default: all) characters starting at start (default: 1)  transliterate parameters:  parametertypedefault  modechinese / de / german / ja / japanese / minimal / zh    transliterates the citation key. If you don't specify a mode, the mode is derived from the item language field  upperForces the text inserted by the field marker to be in uppercase. For example, [auth:upper] expands the last name of the first author in uppercase.   Usage note: the functions condense, skipwords, capitalize and select rely on whitespaces for word handling. Most functions strip whitespace and thereby make these filter functions sort of useless. You will in general want to use the fields from the table above, which give you the values from Zotero without any changes. The fields with ** are only available in Juris-M.\n"

With BBT\u0026rsquo;s export translators (e.g., \u0026ldquo;Better BibTeX\u0026rdquo;), checking the Keep updated option will register the export for automation. After you’ve completed the current export, any changes to the collection or library will trigger an automatic re-export to update the file. You can review/remove exports from the BBT preferences. While I\u0026rsquo;ve gone to some lengths to make sure performance is OK, don\u0026rsquo;t go overboard with the number of auto-exports you have going. Also, exporting only targeted selections over your whole library will get you better performance. You can set up separate exports for separate papers for example if you have set up a collection for each.\nManaging auto-exports After you\u0026rsquo;ve set up an auto-export using an Keep updated export, you can manage your auto-exports in the BBT preferences under the Automatic exports tab. There, you can remove auto-export, change settings on them, or remove them. You cannot add new auto-exports from here, that can only be done by initiating an export.\nGetting your BBT-generated bib(la)tex/citekeys to other places You may want to use your BBT generated bib(la)tex on other systems; maybe you use Overleaf (as I do), maybe you have your documents compiled using github actions (as I do). In any case, you want your auto-exported items to show up somewhere else. If you\u0026rsquo;re thinking of this in the context of Overleaf, here\u0026rsquo;s a TL;DR of the pros and cons:\n Auto-export + cloud-sync  pro: gets the full bibtex file to Overleaf, should be seamless con: have not tested, paid option on overleaf   Auto-export + git:  pro: gets the full bibtex file to Overleaf, tested and works con: requires technical expertise to set up, paid option on overleaf   citekey pinning:  pro: no setup con: only gets the BBT citekeys, BibTeX is generated by Zotero itself    DropBox / Google Drive / Box.com / \u0026hellip; Or any other of the plethora of choices that are available today that will \u0026ldquo;cloud-sync\u0026rdquo; your files. Just auto-export your bib file to a cloud-synced folder, and Bob\u0026rsquo;s your uncle. Incidentally, this should work with Overleaf, but I have not tested it personally, as I use\u0026hellip;\ngit support BBT auto-export works nicely with git services (such as Overleaf, which is where I use it myself; the instructions for setting up Overleaf for git can be found here, but any git service (gitlab, github, etc) should work exactly the same. I\u0026rsquo;m toying with various online services here.\nNote that this is more for the technically inclined, you will need to be comfortable with the command line to set this up. I can\u0026rsquo;t think of a real benefit to using git over cloud-sync unless, like me, you like to keep a backup history in git.\nTo activate git support, first clone the repo that holds your article/thesis/whatnot from your provider (github, overleaf, etc), run git config zotero.betterbibtex.push true in a command shell in that clone, and set up an auto export to that directory; at each update, BBT will now also push your library to the git service. For the technically curious, that means it does:\n git pull Performs the export git add \u0026lt;your library file\u0026gt; git commit -m \u0026lt;your library file\u0026gt; git push  Note that the nature of git commit/push is not file-bound; if you made edits to other files, and added those, they will be committed and pushed along. If you want to be super-careful, the best way to go about it is to have a separate clone of your repo that BBT auto-exports to, and then another repo that you do your own edits in. I don\u0026rsquo;t use it myself this way, but you have been warned.\nPinning BBT citekeys for Overleaf If you only want BBTs citation keys on Overleaf, you can simply pin them and use the regular Overleaf-Zotero integration. This will get you the pinned keys, but the bibtex is generated by the standard Zotero exporters.\n"

Pandoc and scannable cite are the richest ones, supporting all 4. MultiMarkdown supports none. The formatted- formats will ignore these. LaTeX supports all 4, in a way:\n in the latex (natbib) format: if you choose suppress author for none or all of your items in a pick, you will get the citation as you would normally enter it, such as \\cite{author1,author2}, or \\citeyear{author1,author2}. If you use locator, prefix, suffix in any one of them, or you use suppress author for some but not for others, the picker will write them out all separate, like \\cite[p. 1]{author1}\\citeyear{author2}, as natbib doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to have a good mechanism for combined citations that mix different prefixes/suffixes/locators. in the biblatex format: suppress author is ignored unless the command is one of \\cite, \\autocite or \\parencite and there is one items only, in which case the starred variant of the command is returned, which hides the author; for multiple items with locators, prefixes or suffixes, the s-affixed variant of the command is generated  Some of the formatters use abbreviated labels for the results if you include a locator. The defaults are:\n   locator label abbreviation     article art.   chapter ch.   subchapter subch.   column col.   figure fig.   line l.   note n.   issue no.   opus op.   page p.   paragraph para.   subparagraph subpara.   part pt.   rule r.   section sec.   subsection subsec.   Section Sec.   sub verbo sv.   schedule sch.   title tit.   verse vrs.   volume vol.    In your call to the CAYW URL, you can override the abbreviations by adding them to the query, e.g. http://127.0.0.1:23119/better-bibtex/cayw?format=mmd\u0026amp;page=\u0026amp;Section=sec., page-picks will have no label, and Section-picks will get sec. rather than Sec..\nThe clipboard option can be used as a workaround for editors that haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten around to integrating this yet. If you use this option you will probably want to bind to a hotkey, either system-wide (which is going to be platform-dependent, I know AutoHotKey works for windows, for OSX Karabiner ought to do the job, and for Linux xbindkeys could do the job.\nFor example, if you call up http://127.0.0.1:23119/better-bibtex/cayw?format=mmd\u0026amp;clipboard=yes, the Zotero citation picker will pop up. If you then select two items that happen to have cite keys adams2001 and brigge2002, then\n the response body will be [#adams2001][][#brigge2002][], and [#adams2001][][#brigge2002][] will be left on the clipboard  More of a gimmick than anything else, but if you add select=true, BBT will select the picked items in Zotero.\nPlaying around For testing for other markdown formatters, you can construct simple references yourself, using the playground formatter, with parameters:\n citeprefix, default empty, for text to put before the full citation. citepostfix, default empty, for text to put after the full citation. keyprefix, default empty, for text to put before each individual citekey keypostfix, default empty, for text to put after each individual citekey separator, default ,, for text to put between citekeys  Alternately, the json formatter will just give you the picks as JSON which you can turn into pretty much anything if you can code.\nbut if you need an extra format, just ask.\n  For Juris-M, the port number 23119 must be replaced with 24119.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "

I love hearing my software helps you, and it pains me to know that things aren\u0026rsquo;t working for you.\nIf you have any questions on the use of the plugin, please do not hesitate to file a GitHub issue to ask for help.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re reporting a bug in the plugin, please take a moment to glance through the Support Request Guidelines below; it will make sure I get your problem fixed as quick as possible. The guidelines are very detailed, perhaps to the point of being off-putting, but please do not fret; these guidelines simply express my ideal bug submission. I of course prefer very clearly documented issue reports over fuzzy ones, but I prefer fuzzy ones over missed ones.\nSubmitting an issue You can report problems with BBT by opening a new issue on github. Unfortunately, my time is extremely limited for a number of very great reasons (you shall have to trust me on this). Because of this, I cannot accept bug reports or support requests on anything but the latest version. By the time I get to your issue, the latest version might have bumped up already, and you will have to upgrade (you might have auto-upgraded already however) and re-verify that your issue still exists. Apologies for the inconvenience, but such are the breaks.\n You can send off an debug report by selecting Send Better BibTeX debug report from the Help menu. Post the resulting ID (displayed in red) in a github issue. You can send off an debug report for a specific collection or (selection of) items that fails to export by selecting those, right-clicking and choosing Send Better BibTeX debug report  That in itself will in many cases give me what I need. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to copy the generated ID to paste it into the github issue; you cannot call it up later (although you can just do it again).\nFor the fastest fix:\n Please be around for follow-up questions and verification I\u0026rsquo;ve fixed the problem. It\u0026rsquo;s really frustrating for me to get a bug report, work feverishly to get it fixed, and then the reporter having no time to verify it is actually addressed. Please include specifics of what doesn\u0026rsquo;t work. I use this plugin every day myself, so \u0026ldquo;it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work\u0026rdquo; is trivially false. Please tell me what you expected and what you see happening, and the relevant difference between them. Please don\u0026rsquo;t file a jumble of problems in one issue. Posting a slew of separate issues is much preferred, as I can more easily tackle them one by one. Do not hijack existing issues. You can chime in on existing issues if you\u0026rsquo;re close to certain it is the same problem, otherwise, open a new issue. I rather have duplicate issues than issues I cannot close because they are in fact two or more issues. If your problem pertains to importing BibTeX files, you must put up a sample for me to reproduce the issue with. Do not paste the sample in the issue, as the issue tracker will format it into oblivion. Instead, choose one of these options:  Post an URL in the issue where I can download your sample, or Put the sample in a gist and post the URL of the gist into the issue   If your problem pertains to BBT interfering with other plugins (which wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the first time), and this interference has something to do with importing, you must include a sample file that triggers the issue. I know it may seem that \u0026ldquo;any file triggers it\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; I need a specific file that does so I know we\u0026rsquo;re looking at the same problem.  Known problems If Zotero stalls after installing BBT, it is often a one-time thing as the cache fills.\n"

	"content": "Better BibTeX for Zotero Better BibTeX (BBT) is an extension for Zotero and Juris-M that makes it easier to manage bibliographic data, especially for people authoring documents using text-based toolchains (e.g. based on LaTeX / Markdown).\nFeatures Facilities for generating citation keys  Automatically generate citation keys without key clashes! Generate citation keys that take into account existing keys in your library even when they are not part of the items you export. Prevent random breakage! Generate citation keys based on JabRef patterns. Set your own, stable citation keys, drag and drop LaTeX citations, add other custom BibLaTeX fields.  Conversion between formats and encodings   Zotero does all its work in UTF-8 Unicode, which is absolutely the right thing to do. Unfortunately, for those shackled to BibTeX and who cannot (yet) move to BibLaTeX, unicode is a major PITA. Also, Zotero supports some simple HTML markup in your items that Bib(La)TeX won\u0026rsquo;t understand.\n  BBT will convert from/to HTML/LaTeX:\n \u0026lt;i\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;⇔\\emph{...}/\\textit{...} \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;⇔\\textbf{...} \u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt;⇔\\textsuperscript{...} and \u0026lt;sub\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;/sub\u0026gt;⇔\\textsubscript{...}.  More can be added on request.\nBBT contains a comprehensive list of LaTeX constructs, so stuff like \\\u0026quot;{o} or \\\u0026quot;o will be converted to their unicode equivalents on import (e.g., \\\u0026quot;{o} to ö), and their unicode equivalents back to \\\u0026quot;{o} if you have that option enabled (but you don\u0026rsquo;t have to if you use BibLaTeX, which has fairly good Unicode support).\nIf you need literal LaTeX in your export: surround it with \u0026lt;script\u0026gt;\u0026hellip;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; (or \u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026hellip;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;, which do the same) markers.\n  Facilities for exporting data from Zotero  Highly customized exports. Fixes date field exports: export dates like \u0026lsquo;forthcoming\u0026rsquo; as \u0026lsquo;forthcoming\u0026rsquo; instead of empty, but normalize valid dates to unambiguous international format. Auto export of collections or entire libraries when they change. Pull export from the embedded webserver. Automatic journal abbreviation.  Getting started To get started, read the installation instructions.\nHow does it work ? At its core, BBT behaves like any Zotero import/export module; anywhere you can export or import bibliography items in Zotero, you\u0026rsquo;ll find Better X listed among the choices.\nIf nothing else, you could keep your existing workflow as-is, and just enjoy the improved LaTeX ↔ unicode translation on import and export and more accurate field mapping.\nBetter BibTeX works from BibTeXing and Tame the BeaST for BibTeX, and The Biblatex Package for BibLaTeX, but since there isn\u0026rsquo;t really a definitive manual for either format that is universally followed by Bib(La)TeX editors/processors, I\u0026rsquo;m pragmatic about implementing what works.\nGot problems? We got fixes! If you have any questions on BBT\u0026rsquo;s use, do not hesitate to file a GitHub issue and ask for help.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re reporting a bug in BBT, please take a moment to glance through the support request guidelines; it will make sure I get your problem fixed as quick as possible. Clear bug reports commonly have really short time-to-fix, so if you report something, stick around \u0026ndash; it may be done as you wait.\nThe support request guidelines are very detailed, perhaps to the point of being off-putting, but please do not fret; these guidelines simply express my ideal bug submission.

	"content": "Are there any plans to support Firefox 57+? BBT lives where Zotero lives, and Zotero only has standalone these days. BBT is installed inside Zotero instead of in the browser. Please see the installation instructions to get started with BBT.\nAdd-on could not be installed because it appears to be corrupt. You have downloaded the Better BibTeX plugin by clicking on the download link using Firefox. As Zotero and Firefox use the same plugin technology, Firefox think the BetterBibTeX plugin is intended for itself, tries to install it, and then finds out it won\u0026rsquo;t work. You need to download the plugin without installinging it into Firefox by right-clicking the download link, choose save-as, and then install it into Zotero using installation instructions to get started with BBT.\nBBT is changing the capitalization of my titles \u0026ndash; why? There isn\u0026rsquo;t a straightforward one-to-one mapping for all Zotero to Bib(La)TeX fields. For most I can make reasonable choices, but there are some things where Better BibTeX takes a little more liberties with your items in order to get sensible output.\nTitle fields in particular are a total mess. Zotero recommends having your titles in sentence case because that\u0026rsquo;s what the embedded citation processor expects, but of course, BibLaTeX expects your titles to be in Title Case\u0026hellip; but only if they\u0026rsquo;re in English. Nice. In order to translate the Zotero recommendation into Bib(La)TeX best practice, BBT will title-case the titles of English items. English items, as far as BBT is concerned, are those items that have their language explicitly set to an English language (american counts as English for example), and those items that have no explicit language set. To do this, BBT uses the same title-caser that Zotero uses to produce title-cased styles such as Chicago.\nThe titles so modified will then pass through your Bib(La)TeX processor, which will in turn try to lowercase or initial-caps some words and not others \u0026ndash; for English items. But then sometimes, you want words that have capitals to keep. BBT assumes that if a word has at least one capital letter (subject to some rather complex exceptions) you meant it to be there, and you want BibTeX to leave it alone no matter what. To do that, it wraps those (strings of) words in those double braces. This is to let BibTeX know that ISDN may not be changed to isdn or Isdn, regardless of the bibliography style in play.\nThe simplest approach would be to wrap title fields in extra braces as a whole, and some sites will erroneously recommend doing so, but as per Mencken, for every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong; the rules for bib(la)tex capitalization are complex, and this is one of those answers that gets it entirely wrong, even if it will seem to work. There are styles do need to recapitalize parts of the title (for example to selectively downcase the titlecasing), and having the whole field so wrapped interferes with that. So Better BibTeX wraps individual words \u0026ndash; or strings of those words \u0026ndash; that have capitals in them with double braces.\nFor English titles BBT will Title Case and brace-protect your titles on output. Except, those Title Cased words which BBT changed itself will not be wrapped in double-braces, as it is OK for the styles to change casing for those, depending on the style at play. So I like ISDN heaps better than dialup would output to I Like {{ISDN}} Heaps Better than Dialup. Apparently non-English titles are supposed to be in sentence case, so BBT doesn\u0026rsquo;t touch those.\nYou can steer this process somewhat by enclosing the parts you don\u0026rsquo;t want case manipulation on in \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;nocase\u0026quot;\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;. Anything between those won\u0026rsquo;t be touched by Zotero or BBT. This is formally supported by Zotero and will work in the Word/LibreOffice plugins as well as in the BibTeX export. This will be required for words you wish to always keep lowercase, for example. Also, if you don\u0026rsquo;t generally use Zotero for generating bibliographies but just for BibTeX reference management, you can turn on the hidden preference suppressTitleCase to keep BBT from applying title-casing, but take note that if you do this, the bibliographies you get from Zotero and the bibliograhies you get through Bib(La)TeX will differ, and you can\u0026rsquo;t complain about this.\nWhy the double braces? But why then the double-braces ({{...}}) rather than the commonly recommended single braces ({...})?\nThis is not because of some arcane aesthetic preference, but because the Bib(La)TeX case protection rules are incredibly convoluted (#541, #383). For example, here are some \u0026ldquo;interesting\u0026rdquo; cases that BBT has learned to deal with. Did you know that\n {\\emph{Homo sapiens}} un-case-protects Homo sapiens? It sure was a surprise to me. So \\emph{Homo sapiens} is case-protected (will not be recapitalized by Bib(La)TeX), but {\\emph{Homo sapiens}} is not case-protected so it will be recapitalized. So to get predictable behavior, this is written out as {{\\emph{Homo sapiens}}}. casing behavior over the whole entry field depends on whether there\u0026rsquo;s a slash-command at the first position of the title? apparently, to make sure that Reading HLA Hart's: \u0026lt;i\u0026gt;The Concept of Law\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt; renders as expected means I have to output the astoundingly ugly {Reading {{HLA Hart}}'s: {{{\\emph{The Concept}}}}{\\emph{ of }}{{{\\emph{Law}}}}}?  To make matters even more complex, so many people have in the past wrongly recommended to \u0026ldquo;just wrap everything in one extra set of braces\u0026rdquo; that biblatex now ignores exactly that pattern (see here and here).\nThe double-bracing is the only unambiguous rule I could construct that consistently gets the rendered entries right (so far).\nBib(La)TeX provides a never-ending stream of edge cases, which BBT tries to decide algorithmically. I try to keep the resulting file as pretty as I can (I\u0026rsquo;m sensitive to the aesthetics myself), but the target is best described as \u0026ldquo;given reasonable input, generate well-rendering output\u0026rdquo;, and reasonable-to-well-rendering in the BBT case will have to include \u0026ldquo;follows Zotero recommendations for storing items\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;prefer intent-preserving LaTeX over pretty-looking LaTeX\u0026rdquo;.\nBib(La)TeX be crazy.\nBut why so many double braces? Zotero expects titles to be entered in sentence case; bib(la)tex expects them to be entered in Title Case. BBT converts titles to title case to compensate for this. Zotero does allow for exceptions to the sentence-case rule, which you can mark by surrounding them with \u0026lt;span class=\u0026ldquo;nocase\u0026rdquo;\u0026gt; \u0026hellip; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;, and BBT will take that hint and use double braces (see previous sections) to achieve the same effect in bib(la)tex. But BBT does one thing more \u0026ndash; if BBT sees a word containing capital letters which is not at the start of a (sub)sentence (such as the ISDN in I like ISDN heaps better than dialup), it will assume it is a proper noun (otherwise why would a word mid-sentence have a capital letter), and also brace-protect it.\nUnfortunately, there is a lot of variation in how titles are offered by the sites Zotero scrapes \u0026ndash; some sentence case, some title case \u0026ndash; so it is not at all uncommon for title-cased titles to (incorrectly) end up in Zotero, and as a result you\u0026rsquo;ll get a lot of unnecesary braces. For example, if you (incorrectly!) have the following in Zotero:\n I Like ISDN Heaps Better than Dialup\n BBT will export that as\n title = {I {{Like ISDN Heaps Better}} than {{Dialup}}}\n which is clearly not correct. The proper way to fix this is to sentence case this in Zotero \u0026ndash; if you generate a bibliography through Zotero itself, there are styles where this title-cased title will not render correctly. But if you have a lot of these, and you do not care about the quality of the bibliographies generated by Zotero itself, you can disable the title-casing and/or the brace protection.\nImporting JabRef databases JabRef import works generally well but has a few gotchas:\n If you have dynamic (query-based) groups these will not be imported. If you have set a default folder for the pdf files in your JabRef preferences, the file paths in your JabRef database will be relative to that directory, but BBT can\u0026rsquo;t read those preferences, so all attachments will fail to import. You can fix this by going into Jabref and selecting File - Library properties option, then filling out the path to the attachments directory in general file directory.  Background exports have been disabled When BBT encounters an error during a background export, it will automatically disable them; the UI will show Background exports disabled. For reasons that I haven\u0026rsquo;t yet discovered, Firefox (the platform Zotero still builds on) sometimes declines BBT\u0026rsquo;s request for a background thread, and will decline them until Zotero is restarted. In order to let you keep on working, BBT will disable background exports, and subsequent exports will be the normal Zotero foreground exports. You can re-enable the background exports using the parallel exports slider in BBT\u0026rsquo;s Advanced preferences, under the export tab, or by restarting Zotero, which will re-enable them if you haven\u0026rsquo;t manually set the slider to 0.\n"

	"content": "In addition to LaTeX, BBT plays very well with pandoc:\n you can drag and drop citations from Zotero into your markdown documents. you can cite as you write in your favorite editor with varying levels of comfort, mostly depending on how easy (VSCode, Sublime) or hard (looking at you Scrivener) it is to extend your editor. you can even convert your markdown document into a LibreOffice/Word document with actual live Zotero items as if you had entered them into Zotero all along (see below)  Use CSL, not bibtex with pandoc Many tutorials on the use of pandoc to generate documents with citations seem to use bibtex as a bibliography format. I would encourage the use of CSL instead. Internally, both Zotero and pandoc-citeproc use CSL citation engines; the two options you have are:\n    Not only is the extra step through \u0026ldquo;pandoc-citeproc in convert mode\u0026rdquo; unnecesary, the translation between bibtex and CSL is complex and often lossy:\n Because Zotero primarily targets the built-in CSL processor, it assumes titles are stored in sentence case (as CSL styles assume sentence case); bibtex expects title case titles, so Zotero converts titles to title case on export to bibtex. \u0026ldquo;pandoc-citeproc in convert mode\u0026rdquo; will then take that title-cased bibtex and convert it back to sentence case. Neither Zotero nor pandoc-citeproc use natural language processing; the conversion between casing styles is largely done using heuristics. This conversion is imperfect, and you don\u0026rsquo;t gain any benefit from it. The item model of Zotero/CSL on the one hand and bibtex on the other has important differences, and in the conversion, choices must be made on what to put where, and what to drop. Zotero and pandoc-citeproc do not necessarily have the same business rules, and this unspoken difference can be another cause of loss.  All of these problems go away if you just skip the detour via bibtex and export (Better) CSL from Zotero and use that in your pandoc process.\nFrom Markdown to Zotero live citations You can convert a Pandoc-compatible markdown source to a LibreOffice or Word document with live citation fields connecting to Zotero.\n download the Pandoc filter add some metadata to your markdown file in a YAML header:  --- # all the regular stuff you have here zotero:  library: \u0026lt;group name\u0026gt; # omitted to use your personal library  scannable-cite: false # only relevant when you\u0026#39;re compiling to scannable-cite .odt  client: \u0026lt;zotero or jurism\u0026gt; # defaults to zotero  author-in-text: false # when true, enabled fake author-name-only cites by replacing it with the text of the last names of the authors  csl-style: apa # pre-fill the style ... or you can specify them on the pandoc command line:\npandoc -s --lua-filter=zotero.lua --metadata=zotero_scannable_cite:true --metadata=zotero_client:jurism ... And hey presto, a live LibreOffice/Word file, or an ODT file with scannable cites. When you first open the document with live citations, open the Zotero document preferences and click OK before you refresh, or you\u0026rsquo;ll get a confirmation popup for each citation. Also, the Word document is sometimes deemed corrupt when opening it, but running the pandoc command again without any changes fixes it ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ LibreOffice doesn\u0026rsquo;t recognise Zotero citations in DOCX, see issue #2070, and you must use ODT.\nYou can also specify transferable: true to create a transferable document. You don\u0026rsquo;t really need this for ODT or DOCX (just use Pandoc to create those directly using this filter), but it will allow transferring your document to GDocs.\nZotero needs to be running, with BBT installed, while you compile your document.\n"

Plenty (well\u0026hellip;) tools exist to help with the migration of your document content, pandoc being the most prominent one, but one thing none of them will do is keep your citations intact. This will not do.\nIf you install this CSL style in Zotero (or modify it further and use that), Zotero will render the in-text citations as [@citekey] when you ask Zotero to render the bibliography. If you want LaTeX, modify the style accordingly. You can then put your document through pandoc or whatnot to get LaTeX/Markdown.\nFor the curious, BBT does this by patching in the citation-key variable in the CSL processing so it can be rendered using a CSL style. If you previously used the citeprocNoteCitekey preference, that is now gone, so you\u0026rsquo;ll have to update the style you used.\n"

	"content": "The Better BibTeX exporters are a lot slower than the standard Zotero Bib(La)TeX exporters. If you have a small library, you will not likely notice this, but if you have several thousand items, and you are in the habit of exporting substantial parts of your library, this gets annoying really fast.\nTo deal with this problem, Better BibTeX implements an extensive caching system. With a filled cache, Better BibTeX is substantially faster than the default Zotero exporters. Specifically for automatic background exports, a filled cache is a good thing to have.\nFor technical reasons, if you export the file attachments as part of your export, the cache is skipped altogether, so this will always be slow. This is also why you cannot set up auto-exports with file exports.\nTL;DR There\u0026rsquo;s a more technical explanation below, but the TL;DR version is that you want to have a filled cache. If you want to get it over with, export your entire library (once, no need to tick \u0026lsquo;Keep Updated\u0026rsquo;) using the \u0026lsquo;Better BibTeX\u0026rsquo; format and go grab coffee (or lunch, depending on the size of your library). After that, things should be much better.\nHere are some numbers from a test with a library consisting of:\n 24352 items 424 notes 10407 attachments  (attachments are not exported for this test, but they still required serialization and handling):\n   Exporter      Zotero 112s   Better BibTeX, empty cache 235s   Better BibTeX, filled cache 51s    note: if you have \u0026lsquo;Export files\u0026rsquo; enabled during export, or set the JabRef export format to 4, the cache will not be active. If you do large (auto)exports, avoid these.\nCaching Initial state Initially, your cache will be empty. The first export of any item using Better BibTeX will therefore be a little over twice as slow as subsequent exports. After that, it gets pretty zippy, as the process of exporting a item will also cache the output entry for that item for the current export settings. This means if you export once with, and once without notes (one of the options in the export popup), you will hit an empty cache twice. If you set up an automatic export, the export you do that registers it for auto-update will already be the first export, so if your items weren\u0026rsquo;t cached already, they will be before subsequent auto-exports.\nCache refresh The cache entry for a item is retained as long as you do not make any changes to that item. Any change you make will drop all cache entries for that item (so all variants you had for different export options). The cache for that item will be refreshed as soon as you export it again, either manually or automatically.\nCache drop Any change you make to the Better BibTeX preferences will drop the whole cache. The behavior of the Better BibTeX exporters are highly configurable, and it is impossible for me to figure out which entries would be affected specifically. Keep this in mind for large libraries; if you want to make changes to your configuration, make them all at once.\nThe same applies to upgrades. As the export behavior quite frequently changes between versions, Better BibTeX will drop the cache during first startup of the newer version. This can be a nuisance if you have a large library, but it\u0026rsquo;s the only way to keep support feasible.\n"

Scanning can be triggered from the Tools menu (for tagging the cited items) or by right-clicking a collection (for adding them to a collection). The scanner will read your AUX files and will put entries you cited in the associated LaTeX document into the current collection.\nBy default, BBT will add a note for entries cited in the LaTeX document but which do not exist in your Zotero library, but citation keys must be present in your library before the scan is started \u0026ndash; BBT will by default not create new items for citekeys it doesn\u0026rsquo;t already know about. You can enable \u0026lsquo;AUX Import\u0026rsquo; in the preferences, and when that is on, if the scan finds citekeys not already in your Zotero library, it will attempt to read those (but only those) items from the bibtex file named in the aux file.\nFor BBT users who don\u0026rsquo;t use LaTeX directly, you can create a custom aux file to use with the AUX scanner by hand. It is a text file formatted like this:\n\\citation{CITEKEY1} \\citation{CITEKEY2} Where CITEKEY1, CITEKEY2 etc are the citation keys that you want to include in the collection.\nFor pandoc-markdown scanning, BBT needs to actually run pandoc, and for that pandoc must be in your $PATH. On MacOS, if you installed pandoc using homebrew, it will likely not be in the PATH that Zotero can see. This can be fixed using\nsudo launchctl config user path $PATH which will set set the PATH-for-GUI-apps once to your current shell=PATH; if you update your PATH later and you want that reflected in Zotero, you\u0026rsquo;d have to run this again.\nNote that you should not take advice from strangers on the internet asking you to run sudo \u0026lt;anything\u0026gt;\u0026hellip; and I only found this by applying google-fu, not any deep understanding of MacOS (which I do use).

	"content": "You wanted customized\u0026hellip; You got customized. If you go into the Advanced tab of the Better BibTeX preferences you will find a text box (empty by default) where you can edit a javascript snippet which will be executed for each entry generated in the Bib(La)TeX exporter. In this code, you have access to the entry just before it will be written out and cached. There is an API to do this, and it\u0026rsquo;s fairly stable, but usually you can just open a new issue and ask me to write it, and I\u0026rsquo;ll add it here (it\u0026rsquo;s how the examples got here). Postscripts are available in 4 of the translators:\n BetterBibLaTeX BetterBibTeX BetterCSLJSON BetterCSLYAML  You can (and totally should) check in which translator your postscript is running, which you can do by testing for Translator.\u0026lt;id\u0026gt; where \u0026lt;id\u0026gt; is one of these four names, using something like\nif (Translator.BetterBibLaTeX) {  ... } or alternately on the full name using a switch\nswitch (Translator.header.label) {  case \u0026#39;Better BibLaTeX\u0026#39;:  ...  break;  case \u0026#39;Better BibTeX\u0026#39;:  ...  break;  case \u0026#39;Better CSL JSON\u0026#39;:  ...  break;  case \u0026#39;Better CSL YAML\u0026#39;:  ...  break; } If you want to run a postscript in the CSL translators but don\u0026rsquo;t care whether it will output YAML or JSON, you can test for Translator.BetterCSL, which will be true when either one of BetterCSLJSON or BetterCSLYAML is active. Analogously, Translator.BetterTeX will be true if either of Better BibTeX or Better BibLaTeX is active.\nIn the postscript, the entry being built is available as entry, as both entry and this in BetterTeX postscripts, and as reference for legacy postscripts; and the Zotero item it is being built from is available as item.\nYou should really test for the translator context in your postscripts using the Translator.\u0026lt;name\u0026gt; tests mentioned above. If you don\u0026rsquo;t because you have a postscript that pre-date postscript CSL support, you will probably be using the legacy use of this to set things on the entry being built, and calling reference.add in those postscripts; since, for CSL postscripts, this is not set, it will make the script will non-fatally error out, so you\u0026rsquo;re very probably good to go as-is. But please fix your postscripts to test for the translator context.\nThe API for Better BibTeX and Better BibLaTeX The postscript should be a javascript snippet. You can access the data with following objects and methods:\n  item is the Zotero item that\u0026rsquo;s the source for the entry being built.\n  entry is the BibTeX entry you are building, and the entry has a number of fields.\ne.g. you can access the date in zotero item item.date.\n  entry.has is a dictionary of fields for output.\n  entry.date is the parsed and normalized version of item.date.\ne.g. you can see whether the year field has been set by testing for entry.has.year, and when e.g. for a season-date only the year is exported in bibtex, you can find it in entry.date.season\n  entry.add is the function to add or modify keys in entry.has. It accepts the following named parameters in the form of an object:\n name: name of the bib(la)tex field to output value: the value for the field without LaTeX encoding bibtex: the value for the field with LaTeX encoding already applied. If both bibtex and value are present, bibtex takes precedence enc: specifies how to encode the value field. Valid values are:  latex: encode markup and special characters to LaTeX. This is the default, if you don\u0026rsquo;t provide an enc parameter, latex is assumed verbatim: encode under verbatim rules literal: encode under literal rules raw: assume value is already LaTeX-encoded (same as passing the value in bibtex) url: encode as verbatim url   sep: if value is an array, and enc is latex, encode each array element using latex and join the results with the string in sep. Defaults to an empty string. html: boolean indicating whether the value is full HTML (really only useful for notes)  e.g. change the value of year in output entry.add({name: 'year', value: \u0026quot;your_year_value\u0026quot;})\n  entry.addCreators adds the contents of item.creators to entry.\nauthor encoding has a fair number of moving bits and generates multiple fields (author, editor, etc), this function is here so you can manipulate item.creators and call entry.addCreators to replace the existing creator fields on entry.\n  entry.remove removes a field previously added by entry.add or entry.addCreators\n  The API for BetterCSLJSON and BetterCSLYAML  entry is the CSL object being built. Any changes made to this object will directly change the CSL object being output. item is the Zotero item it\u0026rsquo;s being built from.  There isn\u0026rsquo;t really an API. You can use regular javascript to manipulate the entry object, which is a CSL-JSON object.\nDebugging There isn\u0026rsquo;t much in place in terms of debugging, as tranlators (and thus postscripts) are not allowed to do any UI work. You can do old-fashioned printf-style debugging by calling Zotero.debug(...) in your postscript \u0026ndash; it will output the string you pass into the Zotero debug log which you can inspect from the Help menu. You can for example do Zotero.debug(JSON.stringify(item)) to see what the Zotero item looks like to the translator.\nSamples Add accessdate, url for BibTeX Since BibTeX doesn\u0026rsquo;t really have well-defined behavior across styles the way BibLaTeX does, BBT can\u0026rsquo;t generate URL data which is compatible with all BibTeX styles. If you know the style you use yourself, you can add the data in the format you want using a postscript. The script below will add a note for the last accessed date, and a \\url tag within the howpublished field, but only for BibTeX, not for BibLaTeX, and only for webpage entries:\nif (Translator.BetterBibTeX \u0026amp;\u0026amp; item.itemType === \u0026#39;webpage\u0026#39;) {  if (item.accessDate) {  entry.add({ name: \u0026#39;note\u0026#39;, value: \u0026#34;(accessed \u0026#34; + item.accessDate.replace(/\\s*T?\\d+:\\d+:\\d+.*/, \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) + \u0026#34;)\u0026#34; });  }  if (item.url) {  entry.add({ name: \u0026#39;howpublished\u0026#39;, bibtex: \u0026#34;{\\\\url{\u0026#34; + entry.enc_verbatim({value: item.url}) + \u0026#34;}}\u0026#34; });  }  } Comma\u0026rsquo;s in keywords If you want to retain commas in your keywords (e.g. for chemical elements) and separate with a comma-space, you could do:\nif (Translator.BetterTeX) {  entry.add({ name: \u0026#39;keywords\u0026#39;, value: item.tags, sep: \u0026#39;, \u0026#39;, enc: \u0026#39;tags\u0026#39; }); } as the default encoder knows what to do with arrays, if you give it a separator.\nAdd DOI in note field if (Translator.BetterTeX \u0026amp;\u0026amp; item.DOI) {  var doi = item.DOI;  if (doi.indexOf(\u0026#39;doi:\u0026#39;) != 0) { doi = \u0026#39;doi:\u0026#39; + doi; }  entry.add({ name: \u0026#39;note\u0026#39;, value: \u0026#39;[\u0026#39; + doi + \u0026#39;]\u0026#39; }); } Add arXiv data arXiv is a bit of an odd duck. It really isn\u0026rsquo;t a journal, so it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the journal title, and their own recommendations on how to include arXiv IDs is a little lacking: this doesn\u0026rsquo;t say where to include the arXiv:... identfier, and this says not to include it. Nor does it give any recommendations on how to achieve the desired output.\nBut for arguments\u0026rsquo; sake, let\u0026rsquo;s say you get the desired output by including an empty journaltitle field (ugh) and stuff the arXiv:... ID in the pages field (ugh). You could do that with the following postscript:\nif (Translator.BetterTeX \u0026amp;\u0026amp; item.arXiv) {  entry.add({ name: \u0026#39;pages\u0026#39;, value: item.arXiv.id });  if (!entry.has.journaltitle) { entry.add({ name: \u0026#39;journaltitle\u0026#39;, bibtex: \u0026#39;{}\u0026#39; }); } } Custom field order Specify the ordering of the listing of fields in an exported Biblatex/Bibtex entry. Your postscript:\nif (Translator.BetterTeX) {  // the bib(la)tex fields are ordered according to this array.  // If a field is not in this list, it will show up after the ordered fields.  // https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/issues/512   const order = [\u0026#39;author\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;date\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;title\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;publisher\u0026#39;]  for (const [field, value] of order.filter(front =\u0026gt; entry.has[first]).concat(Object.keys(entry.has).filter(other =\u0026gt; !order.includes(other))).map(f =\u0026gt; [f, entry.has[f]])) {  delete entry.has[field]  entry.has[field] = value  } } In Zotero when using an Export Format of Better Biblatex we\u0026rsquo;ll get something like the following entry \u0026hellip;\n@book{nietzsche_1974_gay, author = {Nietzsche, Friedrich Wilhelm}, date = {1974-03}, title = {The {{Gay Science}}: {{With}} a {{Prelude}} in {{Rhymes}} and an {{Appendix}} of {{Songs}}}, publisher = {{Random House}}, origdate = {1882}, shorthand = {GS}, keywords = {Philosophy / General,Philosophy / History Surveys / Modern}, translator = {Kaufmann, Walter}, timestamp = {2016-06-05T20:12:28Z}, pagetotal = {407}, shorttitle = {The {{Gay Science}}}, isbn = {0-394-71985-9}, edition = {1} }  Further details Export to Biblatex/Bibtex.

There doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be a solution that caters for all of these and possibly other packages, too. biblatex has no special fields for dealing with info about physical archives, even if it does have provisions for electronic archives via the fields eprint (identifier), eprintclass (section of an archive), and eprinttype (name of the archive).\nOf the packages mentioned above, only one (biblatex-mla) has a clear schema of how to record archival information (type @unpublished; fields number, library, location). Note that the library field is unique to biblatex-mla. (biblatex does define the field, but never uses it in its standard styles, and we find no indication that either biblatex-apa or biblatex-chicago would use it for a physical archive.)\nGiven all of this, I\u0026rsquo;m going to leave referencing of physical location to postscripts for now.

	"content": "In some cases the Zotero fields do not offer a place to enter the data you need to get your exported entries just right. For this Zotero has a so-called \u0026ldquo;cheater syntax\u0026rdquo; which allows you to add extra \u0026ldquo;fields\u0026rdquo; as separate lines in the extra field all items in Zotero have. These fields are supported by the citation processor inside Zotero, and BBT understands them too, and adds one \u0026ldquo;cheater syntax of its own.\nYou can add such fields by adding each on their own line in the following format:\nLabel: value or the older format you migh have seen, which is supported but considered depracated:\n{:csl-variable: value} The full list of labels and the Zotero/CSL variables they translate to can be found in the table at the end.\nThese extra-fields are available to postscripts as extra.kv.\u0026lt;variable-name\u0026gt;. Which variable it is depends (sorry):\n when you export to CSL, it is attempted to map it to the corrsponding CSL fields; if none are available, it is available under their zotero name when you export to Better BibTeX/Better BibLaTeX, it is attempted to map it to the corresponding zotero fields; if none are available, it is available under their csl variable name  There\u0026rsquo;s three type of fields:\n text date name  Text is just that. For dates, BBT will do its darndest to parse the crazy dates so many people seem intent in using but if you want consistent results, stick to YYYY-MM-DD. For names, use either just text (equivalent to a single-part name in Zotero), or \u0026lt;family name\u0026gt; || \u0026lt;given name\u0026gt;.\nBBT-specific There is also a BBT-specific extra-field format that looks like\ntex.field: value These fields are simply copied to the output by BBT, so if you have\ntex.bestfield: philosophy you will end up with\n bestfield = {philosophy} in the written bib(la)tex.\nYou can make BBT export the field only for bibtex or biblatex by changing the prefix to bibtex. (so bibtex.bestfield:) or biblatex. respectively. Finally, you can use = instead of : as a delimiter, and that will indicate to BBT that what follows the = is \u0026ldquo;raw LaTeX\u0026rdquo;; BBT will not do any escaping and just copy it out unchanged. This means, for example, that you would probably want\ntex.corp: Black \u0026amp; Decker tex.formula= $\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} -p(m_{i})\\log_{2}(p(m_{i}))$ and not\ntex.corp= Black \u0026amp; Decker tex.formula: $\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} -p(m_{i})\\log_{2}(p(m_{i}))$ It is important to note that these BBT-specific fields are not recognized by any other exporter. They might end up in notes for some other exporters; there\u0026rsquo;s nothing I can do about that.\nLabel/variable list note: I list the Zotero fields here, not the bibtex fields. The Zotero fields are translated to bibtex fields but that translation is pretty complicated and I don\u0026rsquo;t have a simple description of it at this time.\n   label type zotero/jurism csl

	"content": "Please DO NOT DO THIS without an open issue on the github tracker. I\u0026rsquo;ve been running tests this way for years, but I\u0026rsquo;d still prefer to guide you through this to prevent any risks to your citation library. The test suite has only been tested on MacOS and Linux. I doubt it\u0026rsquo;ll run on Windows, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know what will go wrong when you test. If you\u0026rsquo;re on Windows, DO NOT run this on the same account that holds your actual Zotero library.\nThe tests require an installed Zotero, python 3.6+, and node 12+, a working gcc, and libgit. On MacOS, that requires:\n brew install libgit2 if xcode-select -p doesn\u0026rsquo;t respond with /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer: xcode-select --install (select install, not get Xcode in the popup that follows).  Then:\n git clone https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex.git cd zotero-better-bibtex pip3 install -r requirements.txt  then a few things I\u0026rsquo;d really prefer you do before anything else. In principle the tests are safe to run on the user account that also has your own library. I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing this for years. Still, it would be good to verify rather than trust this. The next steps are all reversible if things don\u0026rsquo;t go as expected.\n Make sure Zotero is not running. If you\u0026rsquo;re on a Mac, that means cmd-Q copy the Zotero profiles to a safe place. The profiles live in ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Zotero if you\u0026rsquo;re on a Mac, ~/.zotero if you\u0026rsquo;re on Linux. mv ~/Zotero ~/Zotero.saved touch ~/Zotero  this is all temporary, and when all is verified to be setup correctly, we\u0026rsquo;ll undo them.\n~/Library/Application\\ Support/Zotero / ~/.zotero holds the administration of your Zotero profiles. The test setup will add a new profile leaving your existing profile(s) untouched. But better safe than sorry, which is why we\u0026rsquo;re holding a copy.\nThe mv sets aside your library so that Zotero won\u0026rsquo;t be able to find it. The touch creates an empty file in its place. The tests don\u0026rsquo;t use that location, they use ~/.BBTZ5TEST instead, but if for whatever reason that doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, Zotero will try to write to ~/Zotero/something, and since ~/Zotero is now a file instead of a directory, Zotero will complain loudly if that happens, and we know we must back out.\nNow then:\n make sure you\u0026rsquo;re in zotero-better-bibtex ./test/behave --tags @438  and be amazed. Zotero will pop up, load the test library, executes one test, and shuts down. The log file after the tests run will be ~/.BBTZ5TEST.log. The tests do not touch your own library.\nTo restore access to your regular library so you can run either a test suite or just work with your library (but not both at the same time. always fully close Zotero between these).\n rm ~/Zotero mv ~/Zotero.saved ~/Zotero  and you can remove the copy of the profile administration you made earlier. Zotero should now start again normally opening your library.\n"

The defaults should just work, but here\u0026rsquo;s an attempt to describe what they do.\nMaking any change here will drop your entire export cache. This is usually not a problem unless you have a really large library, but you can read about what is involved here.\nForce citation key to plain text default: yes\nIf you have deviated from the default citation key format pattern by [specifying your own]({{ ref . \u0026ldquo;citing\u0026rdquo; }}), you may wind up with non-ASCII characters in your citation keys. You can prevent that using the fold function at the appropriate place in your pattern, but checking this checkbox will just apply fold to all your keys.\nEnable citation key search default: yes\nEnable searching on citation keys. Slows down startup on very large libraries. Requires Zotero restart to enable/disable.\nKeeping citation keys unique Keep keys unique default: within each library\nAuto-generated (non-pinned) keys automatically get a postfix when they would generate a duplicate. By default, the check for duplicates is restricted to the library/group the item lives in. When set to global, the check will include all libraries/groups, so auto-generated keys would be globally unique. Changing this setting does not affect existign keys - for this you would need to select the items and refresh the keys.\nOptions:\n across all libraries within each library  On conflict with a pinned key, non-pinned keys will be default: kept (causes key duplicates)\nThis determines what happens if you pin a key to a value that is already in use in a different item but not pinned there. Neither are ideal, you just get to pick your poison. If you let BBT change the non-pinned key by adding a postfix character, the citation key changes which could be problematic for existing papers. If you keep the non-pinned key as-is, your library now has duplicate keys.\nOptions:\n postfixed (causes key changes) kept (causes key duplicates)  Ideographs in citekeys Apply kuroshiro romajization in Japanese names/titles. Uses a lot of memory. default: no\nWhen on, BBT will load kuroshiro for romajization in citation keys. This uses a lot of memory, easily 100MB. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have Japanese titles/names, keep this off.\nEnable \u0026lsquo;jieba\u0026rsquo; filter in citekey patterns. Uses a lot of memory. default: no\nWhen on, BBT will make Chinese word segmentation available for citation keys construction. This uses a lot of memory, easily 70MB. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have Chinese titles/names, keep this off.\nWarn me when changing citation keys in bulk default: 10\nFor those who are curious about what the Clear/Generate BibTeX key right-click options do, this will warn you if you are doing this on more than 10 (default) at the same time, to prevent your curiosity from changing all your citation keys at once.\n"

This is usually not a problem unless you have a really large library, but you can read about what is involved here.\nBibTeX Export unicode as plain-text latex commands (recommended) default: yes\nBibTeX has really spotty Unicode support, so you generally want this on. It will translate things like accented characters to their equivalent LaTeX constructs on export.\nDisregard name prefixes when sorting default: no\nName handling is a lot more complex than I had ever thought it to be. A lot more complex. BibTeX has really limited ways of dealing with names with particles (van, von, de, etc). If you turn this on, BBT will add code to have van Gogh sorted under Gogh.\nAdd URLs to BibTeX export: default: no\nMost BibTeX styles do not support DOI/URL fields. Of the styles that do support them, many forget to load the required \u0026lsquo;url\u0026rsquo; package, so make sure to load it yourself. DOI and URL fields are so-called \u0026lsquo;verbatim\u0026rsquo; fields, and without the \u0026lsquo;url\u0026rsquo; package loaded compilation will likely fail.\nOptions:\n no in the \u0026rsquo;note\u0026rsquo; field in the \u0026rsquo;note\u0026rsquo; field, but assuming the \u0026lsquo;url\u0026rsquo; package is not loaded in the \u0026lsquo;url\u0026rsquo; field in the \u0026lsquo;url\u0026rsquo; field, but assuming the \u0026lsquo;url\u0026rsquo; package is not loaded  BibLaTeX Export unicode as plain-text latex commands default: no\nBibLaTeX actually has really good Unicode support, so you generally want this off. But for some geezers such as me it is simply more pleasing to have things like accented characters translated to their equivalent LaTeX constructs on export.\nUse BibLaTeX extended name format (requires biblatex 3.5) default: no\nUse the extended biber 2.7 format for names with particles - only works in BibLaTeX 3.5 or later. This biblatex has a new (less ambiguous) way to store creator names. It\u0026rsquo;s technically superior, but the LaTeX world moves slowly, so many people won\u0026rsquo;t have it yet. But if you\u0026rsquo;re an early adopter, you can enable it here\nFields When an item has both a DOI and a URL, export default: both\nDoes what it says on the tin, really. If an item has both a DOI and an URL, you can choose to have them both exported, or either one of them. Note that for BibTeX, you must load the url package when you have doi or url fields. doi and url fields are so-called verbatim fields with different escaping rules, and BibTeX compilation will likely error out without the package loaded.\nOptions:\n both DOI URL  Fields to omit from export (comma-separated): default: \u0026lt;not set\u0026gt;\nIf there are some fields you don\u0026rsquo;t want in your bibtex files (such as note for example), add a list of them here, separated by comma\u0026rsquo;s.\nInclude JabRef-specific metadata: default: no\nExport JabRef-specific fields: timestamps, titles for attachments, and groups for each collection an item is part of. Note that having this on will disable caching in exports, which is really undesirable specifically for auto-exports.\nOptions:\n no for JabRef 3 for JabRef 4 for JabRef 5  Quick-Copy Quick-Copy/drag-and-drop citations Quick-Copy format default: LaTeX citation\nUsed for drag-and-drop/quick copy using Better BibTeX citation keys. In the Zotero \u0026ldquo;Export\u0026rdquo; pane, choose Better BibTeX Quick Copy as the default export format for quick copy, and choose the desired format for the drag-and-drop citations here.\nOptions:\n LaTeX citation Cite Keys Pandoc citation Org-mode select link org-ref citation org-ref v3 citation RTF Scan marker Roam Cite Key Atom (https://atom.io/packages/zotero-citations) GitBook Zotero select link Eta template  LaTeX command default: cite\nUsed for drag-and-drop/quick copy citations in LaTeX format. Set the desired LaTeX citation command here. If you set this to citep, drag-and-drop citations will yield \\citep{key1,key2,...}\nSurround Pandoc citations with brackets default: no\nUsed for drag-and-drop/quick copy citations in Pandoc format. You can use this option to select whether you want to have these pandoc citations surrounded with brackets or not.\nOrg-mode select link default: using Zotero item key\nOrgMode to select items in your library\nOptions:\n using Zotero item key using Better BibTeX citation key  Zotero select link default: using Zotero item key\nHyperlink to select items in your library\nOptions:\n using Zotero item key using Better BibTeX citation key  Eta template default: \u0026lt;not set\u0026gt;\nUsed for drag-and-drop/quick copy citations in Build your own format. This is going to get pretty technical, sorry. You can paste a Eta template here. Inside the template, you will find an array it.items, each of which is a serialized Zotero item. To find out what an item looks like inside the template, export some items as BetterBibTeX JSON.\npostscript postscript default: \u0026lt;not set\u0026gt;\nSnippet of javascript to run [after each entry generation]({{ ref . \u0026ldquo;exporting/scripting.md\u0026rdquo; }}).\nMiscellaneous Automatically abbreviate journal title if none is set explicitly default: no\nIf set, generates journal abbreviations on export using the Zotero journal abbreviator, according to the abbreviation style selected in the list below the checkbox.\nInclude comments about potential problems with the exported entries default: no\nGenerate quality reports for exported entries. These show up only in BibTeX and BibLaTeX report formats and indicate things like missing required fields and duplicate citation keys.\nInclude automatic tags in export default: yes\nSome importers or Zotero extensions (such as the ShortDOI manager for example) create tags on items that are more for item management than that they are descriptive of the item. When this is off, such tags will not be included in the export.\nWhen converting to plain-text latex commands: default: Minimize the number of switches between math-mode and text-mode\nWhen a unicode character can be exported as either a math-mode or text-mode command, map to:\n minimal-packages: if both a math-mode and a text-mode mapping is available, use the version that does not require extra packages to be loaded. * conservative: if both a math-mode and a text-mode mapping is available, stay in the mode of the previously mapped character if possible. This minimizes the number of generated $s in the output. * text: if both a math-mode and a text-mode mapping is available, prefer text. * math: if both a math-mode and a text-mode mapping is available, prefer math.  Options:\n Minimize additional latex packages required Minimize the number of switches between math-mode and text-mode Prefer text-mode replacements Prefer math-mode replacements  Apply title-casing to titles default: yes\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re dead-set on ignoring both BibTeX/BibLaTeX best practice (see the BBT FAQ) and the Zotero recommendations on title/sentence casing, you can turn this off to suppress [title casing for English items]({{ ref . \u0026ldquo;support/faq#bbt-is-changing-the-capitalization-of-my-titles-why\u0026rdquo; }})\nApply case-protection to capitalized words by enclosing them in braces default: yes\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re dead-set on ignoring both BibTeX/BibLaTeX best practice (see the BBT FAQ) and the Zotero recommendations on title/sentence casing, you can turn this off to suppress [automatic brace-protection for words with uppercase letters]({{ ref . \u0026ldquo;support/faq#why-the-double-braces\u0026rdquo; }}).\nCache Retain export cache across upgrades default: no\nBy default, BBT clears all caches whenever BBT or Zotero is upgraded. I can\u0026rsquo;t realistically predict whether a change in Zotero or BBT is going to affect the output generated for any given item, so to be sure you always have the latest export-affecting fixes, the caches are discarded when a new version of either is detected. If you have a very large library however, of which you regularly export significant portions, you might want to retain the cached items even if that does come with the risk that you get wrong output on export that has been fixed in the interim.\nIf you have this on, and you experience any problem that is not the cache getting dropped on upgrade, you must clear the cache and reproduce the problem. When you change this setting, as with any setting change, the cache will be dropped.\nParallel background exports: default: 1\nBBT can now perform its exports in a separate thread, and should no longer block Zotero\u0026rsquo;s UI pretty much regardless of how large your library is. The default of 1 parallel export should suit most needs, but if you have many auto-exports set up, you may want to raise the maximum parallel exports to prevent queueing of exports. It is possible to turn background exports off by setting this value to 0 in the hidden preferences; you will get the old (blocking) behavior back, but you can\u0026rsquo;t complain about Zotero being laggy during auto-exports. All Zotero exports are blocking, and it\u0026rsquo;s a minor miracle I got background exports to work at all.\nEnable caching for background exports default: yes\nEven though BBT exports happen in a separate thread, some work needs to be done before the background export can start. Part of this work is preloading the cache. You can shorten the (blocking) preparation time by turning off the cache, at the cost of longer export times.\n"

Zotero knows these as hidden parameters.\nascii default: \u0026lt;not set\u0026gt;\nIf you have unicode turned on you can still selectively replace some characters to plain-text commands; any characters entered here will always be replaced by their LaTeX-command counterparts.\nautoExportDelay default: 5\nIf you have auto-exports set up, BBT will wait this many seconds before actually kicking off the exports to buffer multiple changes in quick succession setting off an unreasonable number of auto-exports. Minimum is 1 second.

Defaults to once every 5 seconds. Note that your database is always saved when your computer goes idle, or when you exit Zotero.\ncharmap default: \u0026lt;not set\u0026gt;\na JSON mapping from single character to raw LaTeX, to augment the default mapping; these will be applied when you export as ASCII. DO NOT edit this preferencedirectly, but create a CSV (not semicolons) file named charmap.csv in the zotero data directory under the better-bibtex folder with columns unicode (the source character), text (representation in LaTeX text mode, if any) and math (representation in LaTeX math mode, if any, without dollar signs).\ncsquotes default: \u0026lt;not set\u0026gt;\nif you set csquotes to a string of character pairs, each pair will be assumed to be the open and close parts of a pair and will be replaced with a \\\\enquote{...} construct.\ngit default: config\nCan be off, config or always\nimport default: yes\nUse BBTs importer instead of Zotero\u0026rsquo;s importer\nimportCitationKey default: yes\nOn import, assign the existing citation key to the item being imported\nimportExtra default: yes\nOn import, place all bib(la)tex field Zotero doesn\u0026rsquo;t have an existing field for in the Zotero extra field of the item\nimportUnknownTexCommand default: ignore\nWhat to do when encountering a TeX command the parser does not know about. Please only use values:\n ignore: ignore the command entirely * tex: import and mark as TeX code, so on re-export it will be output as-is * text: import without marking it as TeX code, so on re-export it will be treated as regular text  itemObserverDelay default: 5\nI\u0026rsquo;ve had reports where Zotero notifies extensions that items have changed, but if BBT then actually retrieves those same items, Zotero complains they \u0026ldquo;haven\u0026rsquo;t been saved yet\u0026rdquo;.

Only useful when mapUnicode is conservative. Characters specified in mapMath take presedence over characters specified in mapText.\nparseParticles default: yes\nName particle handling. Only turn on when requested and we\u0026rsquo;re talking about it on github.\npatchDates default: \u0026lt;not set\u0026gt;\nImport translators cannot set the date-added and date-modified of the items that are imported, they always get the current time as their date-added. BBT will leave fields it can\u0026rsquo;t map as tex.[field] in the extra field of the item. If you enter a list of comma-separated field mappings here, like date-added = dateAdded, timestamp=dateModified, BBT will offer a menu option to remove them from the extra field and set the corresponding date of the item to their values, assuming they can be parsed as simple dates (no circa and stuff). The default mappings tex.dateadded=dateadded, tex.datemodified=datemodified are always active.\npostscriptOverride default: \u0026lt;not set\u0026gt;\nYou can use a custom postscript per export directory:\n Edit the hidden preference postscriptOverride, and set it to a filename like postscript.js 2. In the directory where you intend to export to, create a file called postscript.js (or whatever you set the preference to) and add the postscript you want there 3. Export to that directory.  A postscript override will disable caching for that export.\npreferencesOverride default: \u0026lt;not set\u0026gt;\nYou can use custom preferences per export directory:\n Edit the hidden preference preferencesOverride, and set it to a filename like preferences.json 2. In the directory where you intend to export to, create a file called preferences.json (or whatever you set the preference to), or called [bibfile you are exporting to].json and add the desired preference overrides in the format {\u0026quot;override\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;preferences\u0026quot;: {\u0026quot;skipFields\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;note\u0026quot;}}. You can get your current preferences by exporting to BetterBibTeX JSON and removing everything except config.preferences, and renaming config to override. 3. Export to that directory.  A preferences override will disable caching for that export.\nrawImports default: no\nWhen you set this on, BBT will import bib files leaving any LaTeX commands as-is, and add the #LaTeX tag for raw re-exports.\nrawLaTag default: #LaTeX\nWhen an item has this tag, all its fields will be assumed to hold raw LaTeX and will undergo no further transformation. If you set this to *, all items will be assumed to have raw LaTeX.\nrelativeFilePaths default: no\nWhen exporting a Bib(La)TeX file, if the attachments are stored anywhere under the directory the bibliography is exported to, use relative paths to those attachments. Caching is disabled when this option is on, so it affects performance.\nseparatorList default: and\nSeparator between list elements in list-type fields.

BBT will tell you what phase the startup process is in (of Zotero and BBT) to prevent support requests for something that I cannot change. Please only use values:\n popup: show a popup during startup * progressbar: show a progressbar in the top of the frame  stringsOverride default: \u0026lt;not set\u0026gt;\nYou can use a custom @string list per export directory:\n Edit the hidden preference stringstOverride, and set it to a filename like strings.bib 2. In the directory where you intend to export to, create a file called strings.bib (or whatever you set the preference to) and add the @string declarations you want there 3. Export to that directory.  A strings override will disable caching for that export.\nverbatimFields default: url,doi,file,ids,eprint,verba,verbb,verbc,groups\nlist of fields to treat as verbatim during import. If you\u0026rsquo;re importing e.g. Mendeley-generated BibTeX, which is out of spec in various ways, try removing file from this list before import.\nwarnTitleCased default: no\nBoth Zotero and BBT expect titles to be in sentence-case, but a lot of sites offer import data that is Title Cased. When exporting these titles to bib(la)tex you\u0026rsquo;re going to get a lot of extra unwanted braces, because all these Title Cased words will look like proper nouns to BBTs own title-casing mechanism. When this setting is on, you will be warned when you import/save items in Zotero with titles that look like they\u0026rsquo;re Title Cased, so that you can inspect/correct them.\nAbbreviation style: default: \u0026lt;not set\u0026gt;\nSelect the style for auto-abbreviation. Only applicable to Juris-M; in Zotero, the style for automatic abbreviation is not configurable.\nCitation key format default: ​auth.lower + shorttitle(3,3) + year\nSet the pattern used to generate citation keys. The format of the keys is documented [here]({{ ref . \u0026ldquo;citing\u0026rdquo; }}).\n"
