      <description>Are there any plans to support Firefox 57+? BBT lives where Zotero lives, and Zotero only has standalone these days. BBT is installed inside Zotero instead of in the browser. Please see the installation instructions to get started with BBT.
Add-on could not be installed because it appears to be corrupt. You have downloaded the Better BibTeX plugin by clicking on the download link using Firefox. As Zotero and Firefox use the same plugin technology, Firefox think the BetterBibTeX plugin is intended for itself, tries to install it, and then finds out it won&amp;rsquo;t work.</description>

      <description>The Better BibTeX exporters are a lot slower than the standard Zotero Bib(La)TeX exporters. If you have a small library, you will not likely notice this, but if you have several thousand items, and you are in the habit of exporting substantial parts of your library, this gets annoying really fast.
To deal with this problem, Better BibTeX implements an extensive caching system. With a filled cache, Better BibTeX is substantially faster than the default Zotero exporters.</description>

      <description>Please DO NOT DO THIS without an open issue on the github tracker. I&amp;rsquo;ve been running tests this way for years, but I&amp;rsquo;d still prefer to guide you through this to prevent any risks to your citation library. The test suite has only been tested on MacOS and Linux. I doubt it&amp;rsquo;ll run on Windows, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know what will go wrong when you test. If you&amp;rsquo;re on Windows, DO NOT run this on the same account that holds your actual Zotero library.</description>
